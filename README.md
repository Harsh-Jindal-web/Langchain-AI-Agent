# LangChain-AI-Agent

This repository provides a hands-on implementation and practical guide to building **AI Agents using LangChain**, which are capable of reasoning, taking actions, and interacting with tools dynamically. It includes annotated code notebooks and summarized notes for comprehensive learning.

## ðŸ§  Overview

LangChain Agents enable **dynamic decision-making** by allowing language models to determine which tools to use and in what sequence, based on user input and evolving context.
